# Social Data Analysis and Visualisation - Final Project

## The Relationship Between Energy Consumption and Social/Economic Measures
The goal of the project is to give people insight into how social and economic differences between countries and continents influences energy consumption patterns. Climate change is one of the large problems that society is facing, and the fact that we have to think about the problem as a global phenomenon makes it tricky. The aim is therefore to serve information about the topic in an intuitive and interesting way, which will then allow people to have informed opinions about the matter and ultimately make better decisions.
